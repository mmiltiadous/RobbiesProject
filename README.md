# RobbiesProject
This is a project about building from scratch a real robot plotter named RoboVinci.

All the procedure followed is described in the report named RobbiesProjectProposal.pdf

All the code can be found in Final.ipynb with headers describing what each section is about.

A demonstration video with RoboVinci in action is also provided in RoboVinci.mp4

In the folder assets you can find the pictures (dolphin.jpg, alpha.jpg, mickey.png) mentioned in the report (RobbiesProjectProposal.pdf)  that were used as input in order to get the drawings that are presented in the report. Additionally, there are the DemoProject.png and circle.jpg which were used for our first tests of the robot. Finally, the plotter-scheme.png is our initial design scheme of the robot before implementing it with real hardware.

## Requirements
For this project, you will need to install the following packages:

```bash 
pip3 install matplotlib numpy opencv-python pyfirmata
```

## Setup and usage 

To use the first you have to build the project as seen in the report, and then just run  the `Final.ipynb` file.
